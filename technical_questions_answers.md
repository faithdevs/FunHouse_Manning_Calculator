## Technical Answers

Please find the answers to all the questions as follows:

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    - I spent 4 hours on the code which includes the time taken to think of a logical possible solution from variety of solutions I was contemplating on. 
    - I think I did the task to the best of my knowledge, but i will still try out better methods using less procesing time if possible. 

2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
    - It is easier to setup a project with php.
    - It has alarge developers community where all the problems that could possibly arise has already been solved. 
    - It is supported by all deployment servers.

3. What is your favourite thing about your most familiar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)?
    - My favorurite framework is Laravel.
    - The documentation is elaborate enough to enable a developer work with laravel without having to watch a youtube tutorial.
    - It handles default security , giving developers more time to focus on the code/logic.
    - It has provided a lot of simple to use packages.

4. What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?
    - When setting up projects symfony can be quite assumptive about what you want. Requiring some extra time to fix the configs.   
    - Your solution can easily become dependent on lot of external libraries / packages and the framework itself that are out of your control.
